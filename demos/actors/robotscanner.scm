;;; =====================================================================
;;; Robot Scanner test demo (from XUDD, originally).
;;; 
;;; Here's the premise.  There's a warehouse full of droids, some
;;; infected, and some not.  The SecurityRobot is being sent in to clean
;;; up the mess.  It's capable of sending a message that infected droids
;;; are susceptible to responding in a predictable way.  Once it has
;;; identified that a droid is infected, it shoots it full of holes till
;;; the droid is terminated.  The SecurityRobot goes from room to room
;;; till things are cleared out.
;;; 
;;; Overseeing the operation is the "overseer".  The security robot keeps
;;; the overseer up to date on its progress as it goes.  (For this demo,
;;; the overseer is also responsible for initializing the world and
;;; reporting info back to the user.)
