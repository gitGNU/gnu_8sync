;;; Agenda definition
;;; =================

;;; The agenda consists of:
;;;  - a queue of immediate items to handle
;;;  - sheduled future events to be added to a future queue
;;;  - a tag by which running processes can escape for some asynchronous
;;;    operation (from which they can be returned later)
;;;  - a mapping of ports to various handler procedures
;;;
;;; The goal, eventually, is for this all to be immutable and functional.
;;; However, we aren't there yet.  Some tricky things:
;;;  - The schedule needs to be immutable, yet reasonably efficient.
;;;  - Need to use immutable queues (ijp's pfds library?)
;;;  - Modeling reading from ports as something repeatable,
;;;    and with reasonable separation from functional components?
